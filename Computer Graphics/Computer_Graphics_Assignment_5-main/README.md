# Computer_Graphics_Assignment_5
This assignment is in C++ and is me modifying terrain and how the player can move within this terrain.

There were 4 steps to this assignment which I will now summarize.
Step 1: I needed to modify the movement_resticted function to make sure the player can not fly through the terrain and rather walks around on it.
Step 2: I needed to add a key that would enable/disable the movement_restricted function that I made in step 1, this key being Y.
Step 3: I needed to further restrict the player's movement and they could no longer walk off the edge of the terrain or go to the ceiling of the space.
Step 4: I needed to place 4 objects which were a sphere, a cube, a cylinder, and a torus on the top of the terrain and also randomize the terrain generation.

This is compiled into an .exe file by using CMake. The .exe and the code are the final products of the assignment, but if you would like to edit the project I recommend you download the zip file instead as it contains important includes for the code.
