# Computer_Graphics_Assignment_3
This assignment is in C++ and is me layering rendered triangles and adding new triangles to the window. 

The two files that are named "fragment_shader.glsl" and "vertex_shader.glsl" are used to color the triangles and help in rendering the objects.

This is compiled into an .exe file by using CMake. The .exe and the code are the final products of the assignment, but if you would like to edit the project I recommend you download the zip file instead as it contains important includes for the code.
