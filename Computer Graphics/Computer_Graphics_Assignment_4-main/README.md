# Computer_Graphics_Assignment_4
This assignment is in C++ and is me creating an animation of 4 blocks, including translations of these blocks.

You will notice that there are 4 variations of this assignment, each of which is a step of the assignment.
Step 1: Create the 4 blocks and apply translations to them in order to have them a certain way.
Step 2: Make the 4 blocks animated around certain axes, rotating at different speeds.
Step 3: Change the coloring of these blocks by changing the coding in the vertex and fragment shaders. (This effectively animates the colors changing)
Step 4: Change the vertex shader to make the coloring of the blocks into quadrants.

This is compiled into an .exe file by using CMake. The .exe and the code are the final products of the assignment, but if you would like to edit the project I recommend you download the zip file instead as it contains important includes for the code.
