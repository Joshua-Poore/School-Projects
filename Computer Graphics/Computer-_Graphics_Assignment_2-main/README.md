# Computer-_Graphics_Assignment_2
This assignment is in C++ and is me modifying a window's name and size.

This is compiled into an .exe file by using CMake. The .exe and the code are the final products of the assignment, but if you would like to edit the project I recommend you download the zip file instead as it contains important includes for the code.
